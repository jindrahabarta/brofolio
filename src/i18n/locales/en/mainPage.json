        "j1": "A creative and a maker. Besides the MotionLabs project, I focus on my own brand @drippy_rugs. Creating original, unconventional and 'cool' things fulfills me incredibly — and this is the perfect outlet for that energy.",

        "j3": "Bored of the standards in web design? Want something more than what a dull template allows you to have? I’ll do my best to turn your ideas into reality!",
        "l1": "I’ve been drawn to technology since I was a kid. Over time, I got into programming and building my own projects.",
        "l2": "And who am I, really? A bit of a swimmer, a bit of a guitarist, a bit of an artist… But mainly a web developer and programmer. Since both my brother and I enjoy unconventional, animated and artistic websites, we created Motion Labs to bring these values to life."
